#  Based on arrangement test #4
#  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EObO0I6EEsIZjXTiinqS6tb4A-tH4W2EGogL2WTc4O4/
#
#  This test aims to establish the musically appropriate way for XJ to apply standard detail programs to a
#  published main program, as compared to a flawed transcribed XJ performance of that main program.
#  Unlike Tests #1-3, this test utilizes:
#    * Slash chords
#    * Four-note chords
#  Test is based on Main Program “Earth 3”, sequence “0”
#
#  XJ has a serviceable voicing algorithm https://github.com/xjmusic/xjmusic/issues/221

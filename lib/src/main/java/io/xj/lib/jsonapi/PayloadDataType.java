/**
 Data Type for a Payload sent/received to/from a XJ Music REST JSON:API service
 <p>
 Created by Charney Kaye on 2020/03/05
 <p>
 Payloads are serialized & deserialized with custom Jackson implementations.
 Much of the complexity of serializing and deserializing stems of the fact that
 the JSON:API standard uses a data object for One record, and a data array for Many records.

Software License for the XJ music system

© Copyright 2019 - 2024 XJ Music Inc. All rights reserved.

1. INTRODUCTION

The XJ music workstation and XJ music playback engine are software that implements the patented XJ music system ("XJ") for generating musical audio compositions, protected by US Patent Grant 10,446,126. This music software is intended to create musical compositions for playback on a wide variety of devices.

XJ is founded on the core principle that music is human, enabling composers to realize new possibilities in dynamic music for video games. We seek to innovate what’s possible. XJ is a new algorithmic medium. We are building a new school of cutting-edge musicians who will put this system to work.

A commercial license for using the XJ music system to generate musical audio compositions in commercially distributed software (e.g., video games) and patent licenses for necessary patent claims for the XJ music system may be obtained through XJ Music Inc. ([http://www.xjmusic.com](http://www.xjmusic.com)) under separate terms from this license.

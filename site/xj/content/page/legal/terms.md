## Description of the Platform

The Platform is a hosting service. Registered users of the Platform may submit, upload and post audio, text, photos, pictures, graphics, comments, and other content, data or information (**"Content"**), which will be stored by XJ™ at the direction of such registered users, and may be shared and distributed by such registered users, and other users of the Platform, using the tools and features provided as part of the Platform and accessible via the Website, Apps and elsewhere. The Platform also enables registered users to interact with one another and to contribute to discussions, and enables any user of the Website, Apps or certain Services (who may or may not be registered users of the Platform) to view, listen to and share Content uploaded and made available by registered users.

We may, from time to time, release new tools and resources on the Website, release new versions of our Apps, or introduce other services and/or features for the Platform. Any new services and features will be subject to these Terms of Use as well as any additional terms of use that we may release for those specific services or features.

## Your XJ™ account

You are not obliged to register to use the Platform. However, access to the Apps and certain Services is only available to registered users. As an example, our App, XJ™ Pulse, enables registered users, who upload and make available their Content to other users, to receive instant feedback on their tracks, communicate with their listeners and manage their Content any time.

When you register to use the Platform, you will login with a Google+ account via Google Single Sign-On. You must ensure that the email address that you provide is, and remains, valid. Your email address and any other information you chose to provide about yourself will be treated in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Google account, and you will remain responsible for all use of your Google account, and all activity emanating from your account, whether or not such activity was authorized by you.

If your Google account is lost or stolen, or if you believe that your account has been accessed by unauthorized third parties, you are advised to notify XJ™ in writing, and should secure your Google account at the earliest possible opportunity.

We reserve the right to disallow, cancel, remove or reassign certain usernames and permalinks in appropriate circumstances, as determined by us in our sole discretion, and may, with or without prior notice, suspend or terminate your account if activities occur on that account which, in our sole discretion, would or might constitute a violation of these Terms of Use, or an infringement or violation of the rights of any third party, or of any applicable laws or regulations.

You may terminate your account at any time as described in the [Termination](#termination) section below.

## Your content

Any and all audio, text, photos, pictures, graphics, comments, and other content, data or information that you upload, store, transmit, submit, exchange or make available to or via the Platform (hereinafter **"Your Content"**) is generated, owned and controlled solely by you, and not by XJ™.

XJ™ does not claim any ownership rights in Your Content, and you hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that Your Content remains your sole responsibility.

Without prejudice to the conditions set forth in [Your Use of the Platform](#your-use-of-the-platform) you must not upload, store, distribute, send, transmit, display, perform, make available, continue to make available or otherwise communicate to the public any Content to which you do not hold the necessary rights. In particular, **any unauthorized use of copyright protected material within Your Content (including by way of reproduction, distribution, modification, adaptation, public display, public performance, preparation of derivative works, making available or otherwise communicating to the public via the Platform), independent of wheteher it is or becomes unauthorized at a later point, may constitute an infringement of third party rights and is _strictly prohibited_**. Any such infringements may result in termination of your access to the Platform as described in the [Repeat Infringers](#repeat-infringers) section below, and may also result in civil litigation or criminal prosecution by or on behalf of the relevant rightsholder.

We may, from time to time, invite or provide you with means to provide feedback regarding the Platform, and in such circumstances, any feedback you provide will be deemed non-confidential and XJ™ shall have the right, but not the obligation, to use such feedback on an unrestricted basis.

## Grant of license

By uploading or posting Your Content to the Platform, you initiate an automated process to transcode any audio Content and direct XJ™ to store Your Content on our servers, from where you may control and authorize the use, ways of reproduction, transmission, distribution, public display, public performance, making available (including whether users will be permitted to listen to your Content offline) and other communication to the public of Your Content on the Platform and elsewhere using the Services. To the extent it is necessary in order for XJ™ to provide you with any of the aforementioned hosting services, to undertake any of the tasks set forth in these Terms of Use, including the distribution of advertising or other promotional material on our Platform and/or to enable your use of the Platform, you hereby grant such licenses to XJ™ on a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully paid basis.

By uploading Your Content to the Platform, you also grant a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid up, license to other users of the Platform, and to operators and users of any other websites, apps and/or platforms to which Your Content has been shared or embedded using the Services (**"Linked Services"**), to use, copy, listen to offline, repost, transmit or otherwise distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, adapt, prepare derivative works of, compile, make available and otherwise communicate to the public, Your Content utilizing the features of the Platform from time to time, and within the parameters set by you using the Services. You can limit and restrict the availability of certain of Your Content to other users of the Platform, and to users of Linked Services, at any time using the permissions tab in the track edit section for each sound you upload, subject to the provisions of the [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) section below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these Terms of Use grants any rights to any other user of the Platform with respect to any proprietary name, logo, trademark or service mark uploaded by you as part of Your Content (for example, your profile picture) (**"Marks"**), other than the right to reproduce, publicly display, make available and otherwise communicate to the public those Marks, automatically and without alteration, as part of the act of reposting sounds with which you have associated those Marks.

The licenses granted in this section are granted separately with respect to each item of Your Content that you upload to the Platform. Licenses with respect to audio Content, and any images or text within your account, will (subject to the following paragraph of these Terms of Use) terminate automatically when you remove such Content from your account. Licenses with respect to comments or other contributions that you make on the Platform will be perpetual and irrevocable, and will continue notwithstanding any termination of your account.

Removal of audio Content from your account will automatically result in the deletion of the relevant files from XJ™'s systems and servers. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby acknowledge and agree that once Your Content is distributed to a Linked Service, XJ™ is not obligated to ensure the deletion of Your Content from any servers or systems operated by the operators of any Linked Service, or to require that any user of the Platform or any Linked Service deletes any item of Your Content. Furthermore, if you authorize any of Your Content to be available for offline listening, after deletion of an item of Your Content or removal from the ability for other users to listen to the applicable Content offline, the applicable Content may still be temporarily available to other users of the Platform who saved the applicable Content for offline listening on their devices, but no longer than 30 days from the time of deletion.

Any Content other than Your Content is the property of the relevant Uploader, and is or may be subject to copyright, trademark rights or other intellectual property or proprietary rights. Such Content may not be downloaded, reproduced, distributed, transmitted, re-uploaded, republished, displayed, sold, licensed, made available or otherwise communicated to the public or exploited for any purposes except via the features of the Platform from time to time and within the parameters set by the Uploader on the Platform or with the express written consent of the Uploader. Where you repost another user's Content, or include another user's Content in a playlist or station or where you listen to another user's Content offline, you acquire no ownership rights whatsoever in that Content. Subject to the rights expressly granted in this section, all rights in Content are reserved to the relevant Uploader.

## Representations and warranties

You hereby represent and warrant to XJ™ as follows: (i) Your Content, and each and every part thereof, is an original work by you, or you have obtained all rights, licenses, consents and permissions necessary in order to use at any and all times during any applicable use, and (if and where relevant) to authorize XJ™ to use, Your Content pursuant to these Terms of Use, including, without limitation, the right to upload, reproduce, store, transmit, distribute, share, publicly display, publicly perform, make available (including for listening offline) and otherwise communicate to the public Your Content, and each and every part thereof, on, through or via the Platform, any and all Services and any Linked Services.

Any user that receives more than two of these warnings is liable to have their access to the Platform terminated forthwith.

We will also suspend or terminate your account without warning if ordered to do so by a court, and/or in other appropriate circumstances, as determined by XJ™ at its discretion. Please note we do not offer refunds to Subscription account holders whose accounts are terminated as a result of repeated infringement or any violation of these Terms of Use or our Community Guidelines.

WHILST XJ™ USES REASONABLE ENDEAVORS TO CORRECT ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PLATFORM AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO XJ™'S ATTENTION, XJ™ MAKES NO PROMISES, GUARANTEES, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED) REGARDING THE WEBSITE, THE APPS, THE SERVICES OR ANY PART OR PARTS THEREOF, ANY CONTENT, OR ANY LINKED SERVICES OR OTHER EXTERNAL SERVICES.

WHERE THE LAW OF ANY JURISDICTION LIMITS OR PROHIBITS THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED OR OTHER WARRANTIES AS SET OUT ABOVE, THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LAW OF SUCH JURISDICTION APPLIES TO THIS AGREEMENT.

IN NO EVENT SHALL XJ™'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE GREATER OF 100 EURO OR THE AMOUNTS (IF ANY) PAID BY YOU TO XJ™ DURING THE PREVIOUS TWELVE (12) MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM MUST BE NOTIFIED TO XJ™ AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH CASES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SUCH LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN YOU AND XJ™ AND ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND XJ™, AND THAT XJ™'S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE LIMITS OR EXCLUDES THE LIABILITY OF XJ™, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND/OR SHAREHOLDERS: (I) FOR ANY DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY ITS OR THEIR NEGLIGENCE, (II) FOR ANY FORM OF FRAUD OR DECEIT, (III) FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED WILFULLY OR BY GROSS NEGLIGENCE, OR (IV) FOR ANY FORM OF LIABILITY WHICH CANNOT BE LIMITED OR EXCLUDED BY LAW.

## Indemnification

You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless XJ™, its successors, assigns, affiliates, agents, directors, officers, employees and shareholders from and against any and all claims, obligations, damages, losses, expenses, and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from:

(i) any violation by you of these Terms of Use;

(ii) any third party claim of infringement of copyright or other intellectual property rights or invasion of privacy arising from the hosting of Your Content on the Platform, and/or your making available thereof to other users of the Platform, and/or the actual use of Your Content by other users of the Platform or Linked Services in accordance with these Terms of Use and the parameters set by you with respect to the distribution and sharing of Your Content;

(iii) any activity related to your account, be it by you or by any other person accessing your account with or without your consent unless such activity was caused by the act or default of XJ™.

## Data protection, privacy and cookies

All personal data that you provide to us in connection with your use of the Platform is collected, stored, used and disclosed by XJ™ in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](/privacy). In addition, in common with most online services, we use cookies to help us understand how people are using the Platform, so that we can continue to improve the service we offer. Our use of cookies, and how to disable cookies, is explained in our Cookies Policy. By accepting these Terms of Use and using the Platform, you also accept the terms of the [Privacy Policy](/privacy) and our [Cookies Policy](/cookies).

## Meetups

XJ™ has an active community of users, many of whom organize and attend face-to-face meetings at venues all over the world (**"Meetups"**). While XJ™ is generally supportive of Meetups and may provide branded promotional materials to help organizers promote their Meetups, XJ™ does not sponsor, oversee or in any way control such Meetups. You hereby acknowledge and agree that your attendance and participation in any Meetups is entirely at your own risk and XJ™ does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions of any XJ™ users or any third parties who organize, attend or are otherwise involved in any Meetups.

## Competitions and other promotions

From time to time, some XJ™ users may promote competitions, promotions, prize draws and other similar opportunities on the Platform (**"Third Party Competitions"**). XJ™ is not the sponsor or promoter of these Third Party Competitions, and does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions or inactions of any third parties who organize, administer or are otherwise involved in any promotion of these Third Party Competitions. If you wish to participate in any of these Third Party Competitions, it is your responsibility to read the terms and conditions applicable to the relevant Third Party Competition and to ensure that you understand the rules and any eligibility requirements, and are lawfully able to participate in such Third Party Competitions in your country of residence.

If you wish to run your own Third Party Competition on the Platform, you are free to do so provided you comply with our Competition Terms, which are available [here](/competition).

## Use of XJ™ players and widget

The Platform includes access to customizable players (**"Players"**), and an embeddable version of the XJ™ waveform player (**"Widget"**) for incorporation into users' own sites, third party sites or social media profiles, whether or not a Linked Service. This functionality is provided to enable Uploaders to put their Content wherever they wish, and to enable other users of the Platform to share and distribute Content within the parameters set by the Uploader.

You may not, without the prior written consent of XJ™, use the Players or the Widget in such a way that you aggregate Content from the Platform into a separate destination that replicates substantially the offering of the Website, or comprises a content service of which Content from the Platform forms a material part. Similarly, you may not, without the prior written consent of XJ™, use the Players or the Widget to embed Content into any website or other destination dedicated to a particular musical (except where the relevant Content is Your Content and you are the person or are authorized to represent the person to whom the site or destination is dedicated), or to a particular genre. You may not use the Players or Widget in any way that suggests that XJ™ or any musical, audio creator or other third party endorses or supports your website, or your use of the Players or Widget. The foregoing shall apply whether such use is commercial or non-commercial.

XJ™ reserves the right to block your use of the Players and the Widget at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion.

## Subscriptions and gift codes

Certain features of the Platform are only available to registered users who subscribe to a "Pro" or "Pro Unlimited" plan (together, **"Pro Accounts"**) or to XJ™ Go (Pro Accounts and XJ™ Go are each referred to as a **"Subscrpition"**).

The purchase of Pro Accounts and gift codes related to Pro Accounts is subject to additional terms, which you will find [here](/terms-pro). In addition, the purchase of subscriptions for XJ™ Go is subject to additional terms, which you will find [here](/go-terms-of-use).

The Pro Account Terms and the XJ™ Go Terms include, amongst other things, terms relating to payment, the conclusion, renewal and cancellation of your Subscription, including your right of cancellation during the first 14 days of your Subscription, and certain technical usage limitations.

The Pro Account Terms are applicable to Pro and Pro Unlimited Account users and the XJ™ Go Terms are applicable to XJ™ Go users in addition to these general Terms of Use when they purchase a Subscription. XJ™ reserves the right to limit the availability of XJ™ Go subscriptions to specific jurisdictions as may be determined by XJ™ in its sole discretion from time to time.

## Changes to the Platform, accounts and pricing

XJ™ reserves the right at any time and for any reason to suspend, discontinue, terminate or cease providing access to the Platform or any part thereof, temporarily or permanently, and whether in its entirety or with respect to individual territories only. In the case of any temporary or permanent suspension, discontinuation, termination or cessation of access, XJ™ shall use its reasonable endeavors to notify registered users of such decision in advance.

You hereby agree that XJ™ and its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any changes or modifications to the Website, Apps and/or any Services that XJ™ may wish to make from time to time, or for any decision to suspend, discontinue or terminate the Website, the Services or any part or parts thereof, or your possibility to use or access the same from or within any territory or territories.

XJ™ may change the features of any type of account, may withdraw or, or introduce new features, products or types of account at any time and for any reason, and may change the prices charged for any of its Subscriptions from time to time. In the event of any increase in the price or material reduction in the features of any Subscription which you have purchased, such change(s) will be communicated to you and will only take effect with respect to any subsequent renewal of your subscription. In all other cases, where XJ™ proposes to make changes to any type of Subscription you have purchased, and these changes are material and to your disadvantage, XJ™ will notify you of the proposed changes by sending a message to your XJ™ account and/or an email to the then current email address that we have for your account, at least six (6) weeks in advance. You will have no obligation to continue using the Platform following any such notification, but if you do not terminate your account as described in the [Termination](#termination) section below during such six (6) week period, your continued use of your account after the end of that six (6) week period will constitute your acceptance of the changes to your Subscription.

## Termination

You may terminate this Agreement at any time by sending notice in writing to XJ™ at 463 Lincoln Pl. #120, Brooklyn, NY 11238 confirming such termination, by removing all of Your Content from your account, or by deleting your account and thereafter by ceasing to use the Platform. If you have a Subscription, and terminate this Agreement before the end of such Subscription, we are unable to offer any refund for any unexpired period of your Subscription.

XJ™ may suspend your access to the Platform and/or terminate this Agreement at any time if (i) you are deemed to be a [Repeat Infringer](#repeat-infringers) as described above; (ii) you are in breach of any of the material provision of these Terms of Use, including without limitation, the provisions of the following sections: [Your Use of the Platform](#your-use-of-the-platform), [Your Content](#your-content), [Grant of Licence](#grant-of-license) , and [Your Representations and Warranties](#representations); (iii) XJ™ elects at its discretion to cease providing access to the Platform in the jurisdiction where you reside or from where you are attempting to access the Platform, or (iv) in other reasonable circumstances as determined by XJ™ at its discretion. If you have a Subscription and your account is suspended or terminated by XJ™ pursuant to (i) or (ii) above, you will not be entitled to any refund for any unexpired period of your subscription. If your account is terminated pursuant to (iii) or (iv), refunds may be payable at the reasonable discretion of XJ™.

Once your account has been terminated, any and all Content residing in your account, or pertaining to activity from your account (for example, data relating to the distribution or consumption of your sounds), will be irretrievably deleted by XJ™, except to the extent that we are obliged or permitted to retain such content, data or information for a certain period of time in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and/or to protect our legitimate business interests. You are advised to save or back up any material that you have uploaded to your account before terminating your account, as XJ™ assumes no liability for any material that is irretrievably deleted following any termination of your account. XJ™ is not able to provide you with any .csv or other similar file of data relating to activity associated with your account, whether before or after termination or cancellation. This data is provided and is accessible only for viewing via your account page on the Website for as long as your account is active.

If you access the Platform via any of our Apps or via any third party app connected to your account, deleting that app will not delete your account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from the Account page within your Settings on the Website. The provisions of these Terms of Use that are intended by their nature to survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement will survive the termination of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, those Sections entitled [Your XJ™ Account](#your-outrightmental-account), [Your Content](#your-content), [Grant of License](#grant-of-license) , [Representations and Warranties](#representations), [Liability for Content](#liability-for-content), [Disclaimer](#disclaimer), [Limitation of Liability](#liability-for-content), [Indemnification](#indemnification), [Termination and Right of Cancellation](#termination), [Assignment to Third Parties](#assignment-to-third-parties), [Severability](#severability), [Entire Agreement](#entire-agreement), and [Applicable Law and Jurisdiction](#applicable-law-and-jurisdiction), respectively.

You may not assign this Agreement or the rights and duties hereunder, in whole or in part, to any third party without the prior written consent of XJ™.

## Severability

Should one or more provisions of these Terms of Use be found to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision(s) shall be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and/or enforceability of the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use, which will remain in full force and effect.

## Entire agreement

These Terms of Use, together with the [Privacy Policy](/privacy) and [Cookies Policy](/cookies), constitute the entire agreement between you and XJ™ with respect to your use of the Platform (other than any use of XJ™'s APIs which may also be subject to separate API Terms of Use), and supersede any prior agreement between you and XJ™. Any modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing.

## Third party rights

(i) this Agreement is subject to the laws of New York State as well as the federal laws of the United States of America, excluding the principles of conflict of laws (international private law); and

(ii) you hereby agree, and XJ™ agrees, to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in the United States for resolution of any dispute, action or proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement.

The foregoing provisions of this Applicable Law and Jurisdiction section do not apply to any claim in which XJ™ seeks equitable relief of any kind. You acknowledge that, in the event of a breach of this Agreement by XJ™ or any third party, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against XJ™, including with respect to Your Content, and your only remedy shall be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in these Terms of Use.

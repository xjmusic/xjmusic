#  Based on arrangement test #2
#  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r-gpTbJV7vl-nRuJkb9Y1-Fgw8A2uD1uy6VzbAXZfX4/
#
#  This test is similar to Test #1 except the following:
#   - The second chord, , occurs at 1.5 instead of 2.0
#   - The Pad/Stab starting chord is in root position rather than second inversion
#
#  XJ has a serviceable voicing algorithm https://github.com/xjmusic/workstation/issues/221
